# OpenPon

***Warning!***  This is still a work in progress. There's no gameplay,
error handling is a bit panicky, and resources aren't included right now.
Sorry about the mess!

OpenPon is a clone of a popular panel-matching puzzle game, Panel de Pon
(aka. Tetris Attack, Puzzle League). The goal of this project is twofold:
to help me develop my skills in Rust, and to pay tribute to this truly
wonderful video game. It's still in early development right now, but I'm
planning to include several features, including support for mods so that
people can do neat things like adding new characters to the game without
having to rebuild the source code.
